		<p>
			I'm Johan, 21 years old student in IESEG who likes e-sport, traveling, surfing and nature. I am creating this web page so you can know more about me and contact me if you have any question about the website we made.

		<h2> E-Sport fan 🎮🔥 </h2>
		<p>
			I've been following E-sports since I am 14 years old, specially the League of Legends scene #AlwaysFnatic. When I was younger, I wanted to become a pro-gamer because I thought that being paid for playing video-games was a dream that all gamers had at least once in their live.

		<h2> Surf 🏄‍♂️ </h2>
		<p>
			When I was 8 years old I started surfing with my best friends and it became one of my favorite things to do. Be one with the sea. It is one of the things I miss the most when I am in Lille.

	<div class="card-white">
		<h2> Nature 🌲 </h2>
		<p>
			Since very young, I have been attracted to nature because my father made me love it with our random explorations across my island by walk or by bicycle.

	<div class="card-white">
		<h2> Travelling ✈️ </h2>
		<p>
			Because I have been "stuck" on an island for 18 years old (some travels here and there), I really want to see other environments, cultures, places, languages, gastronomy,etc. Earth is beautiful and worth to be explored. By the end of my life, I wish explored at least 50 countries and I hope so much more !
